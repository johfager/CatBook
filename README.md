(If you cant be bothered to try it yourself, a demo that shows all functionality 
within the project can be seen in the following URL, https://youtu.be/sWqul0PI9DI)

In order to test locally:
  1. Pull the repository.

For Backend:
  2. Using a terminal, write "npm install" in "Project/backend".
  3. Within the same directory, write "node app.js"
For Frontend:
  4. Open a new terminal, go to "Project/frontend" and write "npm install"
  5. Within the same directory, write "npm start"

You should now be able to test all functionality within the project. Standard port is 3000 so enter "http://localhost:3000/" 
in your web browser of choice.

If you want to see the content of the database, open "http://localhost:5000/getall". 
To delete the content of the database, input "http://localhost:5000/deleteall".
